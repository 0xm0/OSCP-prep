Exam tips (from reddit)
1. Do the buffer overflow first

2. If you can't get a low priv shell, you should either

A: enumerate more or google a way to enumerate the service differently
B: think of how what you enumerated can chain together to get a shell or sensitive information, or C: read the exploit you're sending and see if it needs to be edited.

3. I've seen alot of posts about how the exam machines are different than the lab, and from what I can tell they're different because you sometimes have to piece together more information. Many of the lab machines follow a simple formula of enumerate services --> searchsploit the service for vulns --> use the exploit to get a low priv shell --> privelege escalation shenanigans. However, in the exam machines it sometimes isn't as simple as just searchsploiting a potentially vulnerable service and then exploiting it.

4. Realize when your going down a rabbit hole. This is easier said than done obviously. Sometimes I realized I was in a rabbit hole, when I noticed that I would be typing the same commands I just typed 10 minutes ago, basically trying the same thing expecting different results. Remember that if you've truly enumerated everything and googled for potential exploits, but you still can't make any progress then you might be in a rabbit hole.

5. I found wireshark to be pretty helpful when troubleshooting exploits, might not help for everybody, but I felt it was nice to see what was going on on the network when try to get low priv.

6. Have a solid methodology for testing. This is probably the most important thing, because when you understand where you are in your methodology you can know what to do next. Not just a high level methodology, but one that really goes into detail. For linux privilege escalation mine kind of looked like this:

Look at the custom directories or that you have permissions for, are the files in these directories sensitive? -->spawn a tty then sudo -l, what can you run with root priveleges? Can you leverage any of these programs? --> Check cron jobs is there anything unusual? --> check for permission on sensitive files that you shouldn't be able to read and/or write such as /etc/passwd. --> Check the kernel version, then searchsploit it --> use ps -aux | grep root to look at any services that are running as root. searchsploit these services.

But really try to have one for webapps, smb, windows priv esc, etc...

7. A couple hours before you exam starts, watch ippsec's hackthebox videos. He has convenient markers in the description of each video on when he starts priv esc or web app attacks. Watch the parts that you feel you are weak on.

8. Cheatsheets and helpful links, these will save your life, here are some that I recommend, but there are many many more especially on this subreddit:

https://backdoorshell.gitbooks.io/oscp-useful-links/content/ - general oscp help

https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop - windows and linux priv esc help

https://github.com/DigitalAftermath/EnumerationVisualized/wiki - help enumeration guide

9. Keep notes on the steps you've taken and information you've gained so far for your machine. This one is big help, helps you keep track of where you are. Same thing for your lab machines.

10. Don't forget to take screenshots ESPECIALLY of local.txt and proof.txt with ifconfig/ipconfig. I wasted so much time, because towards the end I had to retrace my steps and get the screenshots.

11. Offsec won't make you reinvent the wheel so to speak. In other words you won't need super complicated exploits to get root. The type of exploits that work on these machines will make you think "why didn't I think of that sooner?" But at the same time, the answer isn't right in your face.
