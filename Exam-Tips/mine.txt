If you're stuck in the lab/exam unable to run exloit, find vuln.. etc. 
Look for the product name with association to vulnhub or Hackthebox 
> sometimes these are 1:1 as the lab practice for example apache + postfix + vulnhub > google result shows dedicated write up for this exact match.

Reconnaisance tips:
If a specific web app doesn't seem to have any directories exposed - 
try to test the name of the domain/subdomain as a potential directory.
OR
CMS name/ forum name/ users / other indicators. 
e.g. > target.e231.com/e231 or  target.e231.com/target

Viewing L***.txt or P***.txt 
If  can't open or view 
try cat -A 
try with vim 
if viewing doesnt work at all - download to local machine
