If you're stuck in the lab/exam unable to run exloit, find vuln.. etc. 
Look for the product name with association to vulnhub or Hackthebox 
> sometimes these are 1:1 as the lab practice for example apache + postfix + vulnhub > google result shows dedicated write up for this exact match.

Reconnaisance tips:
If a specific web app doesn't seem to have any directories exposed - 
try to test the name of the domain/subdomain as a potential directory. often that is the case.
e.g. > xaxa1.e231.com/e231 or  xaxa1.e231.com/xaxa1
