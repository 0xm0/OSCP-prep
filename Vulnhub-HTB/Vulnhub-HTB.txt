Vulnhub VMs

A few Vulnhub VMs. I recommend trying out a few before the exam or when your lab time expires.

Another good advice is to read/watch the walkthroughs of those machines. Try to root them yourself first!

HackTheBox (HTB)

HTB is a penetration testing platform with many machines that feel like they belong in the OSCP labs. All you have to do is pass the registration challenge and only then, you will have your VPN access provided. I suggest doing a few as it is free and an excellent way to prepare for the exam without downloading a vulnerable VM.
