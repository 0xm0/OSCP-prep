# Directory Listing 
~~~
Directory listing is a web server function that displays a list of all the files when there is not an index file, 
such as index.php and default.asp in a specific website directory. 
~~~ 

# How it works 
~~~
When a user requests www.site.com without specifying a file, the web server will process this request and return the index file for 
that directory, and the actual website will show up. However, if the index file does not exist, the web server will return a list of 
the contents of that directory. This functionality can be paralleled with the directory listing command in operating systems’ command 
line, such as ‘ls’ on Unix and Linux systems and ‘dir’ on Windows. It should be noted the Directory Listing might be caused, as well, by exploiting any software vulnerabilities using special requests.

# Mitigation

# Disable directory listing on Tomcat server
In Tomcat 5.0 directory listing is disabled by default. However, it is possible to disable directory listing 
if it was enabled because of a regression or configuration changes. We can configure directory listing in 
two different dimensions: The first one will affect all our web projects and the second one will only 
affect a specified website.
Disabling Directory Listing in All Web Projects

To disable directory listing on the Tomcat web server, open the conf/web.xml file in the directory where 
Tomcat is installed. In our test on Windows 10, the default installation directory 
was “C:\Program Files (x86)\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0”
