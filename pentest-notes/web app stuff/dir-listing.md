# Directory Listing 
~~~
Directory listing is a web server function that displays a list of all the files when there is not an index file, 
such as index.php and default.asp in a specific website directory. 
~~~ 

# How it works 
~~~
When a user requests www.site.com without specifying a file, if the index file does not exist, the web server will return a list of 
the contents of that directory. this is similar to ‘ls’ on Unix and Linux systems and ‘dir’ on Windows. It should be noted the Directory Listing might be caused, as well, by exploiting any software vulnerabilities using special requests.
