Security Misconfiguration

What is it?

Covering a broad range of potential weaknesses, this category of vulnerabilities is actually the most prevalent in web apps today (OWASP Top 10 isn’t ranked on prevalence but rather seriousness, hence why it occupies the number 6 spot here). This can include insecure default configurations, incomplete configurations, misconfigured HTTP headers or exposed error messages which guide attackers in their search for vulnerabilities.
When Does it Happen?

A number of different features can constitute misconfigurations, including:

    Failure to sufficiently harden the application (a lack of firewall, or a misconfigured one).
    Unnecessary exposure, whether it be in the form of web pages, unused accounts or unrequired services.
    Default usernames/passwords kept for administrative tools/hardware — there are many sites containing default credentials widely available such as http://www.phenoelit.org/dpl/dpl.html.
    Error messages are outputted on the web server. This can be particularly dangerous if they are overly verbose, potentially revealing file paths, configuration details and version information.
    The server does not send security headers (things like Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy etc), or fails to appropriately set their values.

How to Mitigate Security Misconfigurations

    Take a minimalist approach to your web app — if a feature, framework or function is not required, remove it.
    Ensure that all available updates and patches are applied as soon as possible. Conduct routine checks to ensure this requirement is met.
    Review cloud storage permissions.
    Ensure your HTTP headers are secure — consult OWASP’s guide here for reference or scan your website’s headers by using the free scanner available at https://securityheaders.com.
    Introduce an automated process to routinely check misconfigurations (using Selenium or an equivalent framework).
